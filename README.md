===============

Since old one on web is written in HTML, I'ld love to migrate it for Markdown.

This process should be done by hand, cause markdown is fun to write,
also this is a great chance to review our article again.

Markdown compatible should be a Drupal-level to render correctly on migration.

(but i do really want it to be a GFM style, it is really good for code-docs).

Drupal Module
-------------

- Markdown
- Syntaxhighlighter
